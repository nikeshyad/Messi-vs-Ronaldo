scrape.py scrapes the football data of Messi and Ronaldo from the website "messivsronaldo.net". The program generates three csv files containing the data "goals scored", "assists" and "appearances" of both messi and ronaldo in each of champions league, la liga and all competitions. The generated files are then imported in R studio from the codes in R markdown file, and after some data cleaning, analysis is done with different plots.
